Dice Rolling Challenge

Challenge from Angela Yu, taken from the Web Dev Bootcamp 2023 on Udemy.

Goals to be achieved:

1. Create Number Randomizer in Variable.
2. Use DOM Methods to randomize the URL for both Dice Player Images src.
3. Utilise Methods from earlier in course to make game function correctly.

Note: Created a Function to run the game to attach to the "Play Again" button with an 'onclick' method.
Creating better user experience and not relying on the DOM refreshing for results.
